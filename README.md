# Real-Time Human Pose Estimation with MediaPipe

![Demo Video] : https://github.com/Navid-Shaikh/Human-Pose-Estimation-Project/blob/main/demo.mp4

A real-time human pose estimation project built using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**. Detects 33 key body landmarks from your webcam, draws a smooth skeleton overlay, and runs in **full-screen mode** for an immersive demo.

This is a solid foundation for my ongoing final-year project on **exercise tracking and posture analysis**!

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time pose detection with Google's pre-trained MediaPipe model
- High accuracy (`model_complexity=2`, smoothed landmarks, higher confidence thresholds)
- Full-screen immersive display (1920x945)
- Toggle full-screen with **F** key
- Higher webcam resolution (1280x720) for better input quality
- Smooth, stable tracking with reduced jitter
